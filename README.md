# RusLearn
A crowd-sourced platform for learning the Russian language through flashcards and memorization techniques.

You can try RusLearn [here](https://still-depths-20210.herokuapp.com/).

## Description:
In its current stage, RusLearn is a web-application that accompanies users on the journey of learning the Russian language by:
- Applying flashcards memorizing technique
  
- Offering both standard and community-based flashcard packs.
  
- Offering premium subscriptions besides the free plans.
  
The initial idea of RusLearn stems from the following problems:
- The shortage of similar applications on the market
  
- The similar applications don't offer the same set of features
- Costly subscription that can't be afforded by students.

In the long-term, RusLearn might extend into a multi-platform learning application, with support for many languages.
